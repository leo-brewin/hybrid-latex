1. Non-trivial refactoring of the build/install scripts.
   This was both to tidy the file structure as well as to simplify the installation
   process. The default install is now as simple as "source SETPATHS; make install".
   Almost all install/build/test/clean actions are now controlled by Makefiles.

2. Updated cdbpreproc.py.
   The Cadabra preprocessor will strip any in-line comments (such as cdb tags) from
   what it thinks are short lines. This failed for some of the examples (some in line
   comments were not deleted). This was fixed by changing how long a short line should be,
   from 100 to 200. If the line is longer thn 200 characters it is deemed to be a long line
   even if the comment begins well before the 200 character limit.

3. Replaced merge-tex.py with merge-src.py.
   3.1 The new code preserves the indentation level for each included file.
       This is essential for Python and Cadabra sources.
   3.2 Expanded the syntax for Input statements.
       Can now include a file using any of
          \Input{file}
          $Input{file}
          @Input{file}

4. Added the date to the footline of each example.

5. Fixed an alignment issue in python/examples/example-08.
   In the section "Visible Python code" the text on two consecutive
   pages should have exactly the same vertical alignment.
   But there was small jump. This was traced to an errant % comment.
   The upshot is that the LaTeX environments in that section need
   to be in vertical mode for the alignments to be correct.
   See the commented note in the example-08.tex source.
