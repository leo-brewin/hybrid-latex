Cadabra latex output for component expressions always use \square
and the {aligned} environment. Thus we need both amsmath and amssymb.
These have been included in the cdblatex.sty file.

Users will also need to add

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}

and maybe

\usepackage{breqn}

if they don't use the cdblatex.sty or cdblatex.cls files.
