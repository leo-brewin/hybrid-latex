I no longer have a valid licence for Maple, Mathematic or Matlab.
Thus all codes that use those programs have been frozen in time.
All results for Maple, Mathematica and Matlab are from when I
last had a licence, that would be around Nov 2021.

If you attempt to run any of the hybrid-latex scripts for any
of the above programs, you will most likely wipe out the 'frozen'
results. That's probably not a good idea. Either make a secure
copy befor playing such games or get a licence :).

The good news is that none of the example have been updated since
I lost my licences so nothing is really lost. But should you want
to make your own changes to the examples you will need a valid licence
to run the scripts.
